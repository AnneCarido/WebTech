      <h1>The Exit</h1>
      <h3>Song by Conan Gray</h3>
      <hr>

<p>February, and the flowers haven't even wilted<br>
It's crazy how fast you tilted<br>
The world that we were busy buildin</p>

<p>Mid November, and I'm sippin' on a half-cold coffee<br>
Starin' at a girl who's not me<br>
On your arm, a carbon copy</p>

<p>Feels like we had matching wounds<br>
But mine's still black and bruised<br>
And yours is perfectly fine now<br>
Feels like we buried alive<br>
Something that never died<br>
So God, it hurt when I found out</p>

<p>You love her, it's over<br>
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (What do you say, say?)<br>
You love her, it's over<br>
You already found someone to miss<br>
Whilе I'm still standin' at the exit</p>

<p>(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)<br>
I'm still standin' at the еxit<br>
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)</p>

<p>I can't hate you for getting everything we wanted<br>
I just thought that I would be part of it<br>
I was movin' into your apartment</p>

<p>When you met someone, she's from your hometown<br>
You hate the East coast, it's where you live now<br>
Impossible to understand<br>
How you're not comin' back, but I can't say it out loud</p>

<p>You love her, it's over<br>
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (What do you say, say?)<br>
You love her, it's over<br>
You already found someone to miss<br>
While I'm still standin' at the exit</p>

<p>(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)<br>
I'm still standin' at the exit<br>
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)</p>

<p>Feels like we had matching wounds<br>
But mine's still black and bruised<br>
And yours is perfectly fine<br>
Feels like we buried alive<br>
Something that never died<br>
So God, it hurt when I found out</p>

<p>(Feels like we had matching wounds) you love her<br>
It's over (but mine's still black and bruised)<br>
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (And yours is perfectly fine now, what do you say, say?)<br>
(Feels like we buried a life) you love her<br>
It's over (something that never died)<br>
You already found someone to miss (so God, it hurt when I found out)</p>

<p>You love her, it's over<br>
You already found someone to miss</p>
